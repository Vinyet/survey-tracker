# SURVEY TRACKER

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## DEFINITION

The Survey Tracker app connects to Excel files stored in Sharepoint via a registered Microsoft Azure application. The app has both read and write permissions. Its goal is to document and track the status of academic surveys: launch calendar, download calendar, ETL process, and Power BI publication status.

The next step is to connect the Survey Tracker app to our Power BI Workspace via API to retrieve data on whether a given survey is currently available on the Power BI app that's available to stakeholders.
